# Docs

This repo will store assorted documentation that doesn't really belong anywhere else â€” things like the [Idea Bucket](https://github.com/cdig/docs/wiki/Idea-Bucket), [CLI notes](https://github.com/cdig/docs/wiki/CLI-Notes), the [LBS wiki](https://github.com/cdig/docs/wiki), etc.

**Everything in this repo is public**, so if we have something sensitive we should put it in Google Docs, Trello, Dropbox, etc.
